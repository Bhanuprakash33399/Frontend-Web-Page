        <h1>Testing</h1>
        <p>Software testing is an essential process in the software development life cycle, ensuring that software applications meet quality standards, perform as expected, and deliver value to end-users. By employing various testing techniques, tools, and best practices, organizations can mitigate risks, improve software quality, and achieve their business objectives effectively.</p>

        <p>Testing is the process of running a program or part of a program to find errors. It's an important part of software development that helps ensure code quality.</p>
        <h2>Through Web Development:</h2>
        <h3>Testing Life Cycle:</h3>
        <h4>Software testing typically follows a structured testing life cycle, which includes phases such as test planning, test design, test execution, defect tracking, and test closure. Each phase involves specific activities aimed at ensuring thorough testing of the software.</h4>
        <h3>Tools and Techniques:</h3>
        <h4>Software testing employs various tools and techniques to automate testing processes, manage test cases, and analyze test results. Common testing tools include Selenium for automated web testing, JMeter for performance testing, and JIRA for defect tracking and management.</h4>
        <h3>Types of Testing:</h3>
        <h4>Software testing encompasses various types, including:

            <br><br>Functional Testing: This type of testing evaluates the functionality of the software by testing individual functions or features against specified requirements.
            <br><br>Non-Functional Testing: Non-functional testing focuses on aspects such as performance, security, usability, and reliability of the software.
            <br><br>Regression Testing: Regression testing ensures that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing features or functionalities.
            <br><br>User Acceptance Testing (UAT): UAT involves testing the software in a real-world environment by end-users to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations.
            <br><br>Automated Testing: Automated testing involves using tools and scripts to execute test cases and compare actual results with expected results automatically.
            <br><br>Manual Testing: Manual testing involves human testers executing test cases and verifying the software's behavior against predefined criteria.</h4>
        <h3>Effective software testing offers several benefits, including:</h3>
        <h4>Improved software quality and reliability
            <br><br>Reduced risks of defects and failures in production
            <br><br>Enhanced user satisfaction and confidence in the software
            <br><br>Cost savings by identifying and fixing defects early in the development cycle</h4>
